Tulane-Websites
===============

Some very rudimentary sites I put up, roughly once a week, while taking a webpage design and development course with Tulane. Nothing fancy, just showing basic HTML/CSS skill.


Course description reads:

This course goes beyond mere use of the Internet into the tools and techniques needed to successfully publish digital media. Through lectures, class discussions, and hands-on lab work, you will become acquainted with the hardware, software (on workstations, on servers, and on the Internet), and tool management techniques needed to create and maintain web documents and sites. The course includes coverage of HTML and CSS.
