    <p>The most influential writer in all of English literature, William Shakespeare was
    born in 1564 to a successful middle-class glove-maker in Stratford-upon-Avon,
    England. Shakespeare attended grammar school, but his formal education proceeded no
    further. In 1582 he married an older woman, Anne Hathaway, and had three children
    with her. Around 1590 he left his family behind and traveled to London to work as an
    actor and playwright. Public and critical acclaim quickly followed, and Shakespeare
    eventually became the most popular playwright in England and a part-owner of the
    Globe Theater.</p>

    <p>His career bridged the reigns of Elizabeth I (ruled 1558&#45;1603) and James I (ruled
    1603&#45;1625), and he was a favorite of both monarchs. Indeed, James granted
    Shakespeare&#39;s company the greatest possible compliment by bestowing upon its members
    the title of King&#39;s Men. Wealthy and renowned, Shakespeare retired to Stratford and
    died in 1616 at the age of fifty-two. At the time of Shakespeare&#39;s death, literary
    luminaries such as Ben Jonson hailed his works as timeless.</p>
