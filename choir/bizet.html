          <h2>Georges Bizet (1838-1875)</h2>

          <p>The composer of the classic opera "Carmen" was born in 1838 near Paris.
          Bizet's first teacher was his father, a noted voice teacher and pianist. Later
          he studied at the Paris Conservatory, where one of his instructors was Gounod.
          At 19, Bizet won the prestigious Prix de Rome.</p>

          <p>Bizet's first opera, "La Maison du Docteur," was written when he was only
          14. He wrote "Le Docteur Miracle" in 1857, winning the Prix de Rome. This piece
          was later performed at the Bouffes-Parisiens. Bizet used the prize money from
          the award to subsidize his stay in Paris. From 1858 to 1860, Bizet started
          several operas, but managed to only finish one, "Don Procopio." This opera,
          written in 1859, was not put on stage until 1906. Lacking commercial success,
          Bizet made his living from teaching the piano, and as a accompanist for other
          people's work.</p>

          <p><img class="floatright" src="bizet.jpg" alt="bizet" />Yet, he still wrote.
          The 1863 opera, "Les PÃªcheurs de Perles," takes place in the Orient, and
          probably contains material from his earlier, unfinished operas. The opera did
          not meet with either commercial or critical success. Hector Berlioz, who
          praised the opera, was one notable exception. Nevertheless, Bizet received a
          commission for another work, the five-act "Ivan IV" in 1865. Sadly, production
          on this opera had to be abandoned after many delays and problems. "Ivan IV" had
          to wait until 1946 before being received on stage.</p>

          <p>Other operas followed, by none of them were commercial or critical
          successes. The production of "La Jolie Fille de Perth" was met with better
          reviews, but not commercial acclaim. The same was true of "Djamileh," written
          in 1871.</p>

          <p>Despite his failures, Bizet was asked to write an opera based on Merimee's
          "Carmen." Controversy surrounded the piece because of its subject matter. Bizet
          refused to water-down the material, despite the fear that the opera would
          alienate the public. The public was alienated. The opera closed after only 48
          performances. Yet, a year after Bizet's death, the piece was revived with a
          series of triumphant performances in Vienna. "Carmen" is recognized as Bizet's
          masterpiece, and a classic.</p>

          <p>Bizet died in 1875 at the age of 42.</p>
