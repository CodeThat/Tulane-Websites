          <h2>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791)</h2>

          <p>Born in Salzburg, the son of a composer, Mozart was a musical prodigy. From
          a very early age, his father exhibited him in Paris, Munich, London, and
          Vienna. From his travels with his father, Mozart was exposed to a wide variety
          of musical styles. From a very early age, Mozart showed a mastery of the
          operatic style. At the age of 12, he composed the singspiel, "Bastien and
          Bastienne," and a year later, the opera buffe, "La Finta Semplice."</p>

          <p><img class="floatright" src="mozart.jpg" alt="mozart" />In 1775, Mozart held
          an unrewarding position in the Salzburg court. Mozart traveled widely with his
          mother, searching for a more prestigious position, but none materialized. While
          in Munich in 1781, he composed the opera, "Idomeneo." He later resigned from
          his post in Salzburg, taking up permanent residence in Vienna in the hopes of
          becoming a court composer. There he married Constanze Weber.</p>

          <p>Mozart met with moderate success in Vienna. It was there that he composed
          the singspiel, "Die EntfÃ¼hrung aus dem Serail," and the popular "Marriage of
          Figaro." The success of "Figaro" resulted in a commission for "Don Giovanni,"
          composed in 1787. Also in that year, Mozart received an appointment to the
          Vienna court. The prestigious appointment did not solve Mozart's chronic
          financial problems. His prospects did not improve either, when the
          unsympathetic Leopold II ascended to the throne.</p>

          <p>With his health deteriorating, Mozart composed the opera, "La Clemenza di
          Tito" for the new emperor's coronation.</p>

          <p>Mozart died in Vienna in 1791 at the age of 35.</p>
