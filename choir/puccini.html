          <h2>Giacomo Puccini (1858 - 1924)</h2>

          <p>Giacomo Puccini was born on December 22, 1858, to a family of church
          musicians in Lucca. He first studied with his uncle at the Instituto Pacini in
          Lucca, but a performance of Verdi's "Aida" brought forth a love for operatic
          composition. Puccini attended the Milan Conservatory and studied under Bazzini
          and Ponchielli. His first opera, "Le Villi," was written in 1884, at the age of
          26.</p>

          <p><img class="floatright" src="puccini.jpg" alt="puccini" />The opera "Edgar,"
          written in 1893, was a failure, but "Manon Lescaut" proved to be an
          international success. More successes followed, including three of the most
          popular operas in history: "La BohÃ¨me" (1896), "Tosca" (1900), and the
          incomparable "Madama Butterfly," written in 1904. For each opera, Puccini
          collaborated with the librettists Illica and Giacosa. The successful team broke
          up with Giacosa's death in 1906.</p>

          <p>Domestic tragedies plagued the rest of Puccini's life. His next opera, "The
          West," did not appear until 1910. Although containing many musical and
          stylistic innovations, this opera has never received the popular acclaim of his
          earlier work.</p>

          <p>Puccini's final opera, "Turandot," produced in 1926, is a grand and
          ambitious piece. Sadly, the work was unfinished and the final act had to be
          written by Franco Alfano. The conductor, Leopold Stokowski, later refused to
          conduct the final act; instead, he told the audience, "and here the composer
          laid down his pen." Stokowski then left the stage.</p>

          <p>Puccini died on November 29, 1924 in Brussels at the age of 65.</p>
