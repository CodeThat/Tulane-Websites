<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Linear Smith Machines are the ultimate in weight machines and the <b>LSM400</b>
leads the field. Designed for both serious fitness users and beginners, the
<b>LSM400's</b> vertical design provides all of the safety and control associated
with Smith Machines, while still allowing for the effective use of gravity
for effective resistance. You don't even need a workout partner. Lock points
can be set to prevent the bar from movement outside of your body's natural
range of motion.</p>

<p>You can tailor the <b>LSM400</b> to meet you specific workout needs. Start with the
basic package of the Smith Machine rack and, as your needs grow, add a 
lat/row, pec dec, plate tree, dip, and accessory organizer. Accessories are easy
to insert and remove, allowing you to continue your workout without delay.   
The <b>LSM400</b> works with all standard Olympic weight plates</p>

<p>The <b>LSM400</b> is compact with all components place one side of the unit for easy
access. This makes the <b>LSM400</b> perfect for people who want a quality home gym, but
do not have a lot of space. Place the <b>LSM400</b> against a wall and you're ready
to go!</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<li><b>Safety:</b> The LSM400 has 20 lock-out points for a safe, solid stop at any point in your workout routine.</li>
<li><b>Rugged:</b> Constructed with heavy 12 gauge steel and 7 gauge reinforcing plate. This is a unit built to last.</li>
<li><b>Warranty:</b> Every part of the LSM400 has a lifetime guarantee. We will replace or repair anything that goes wrong.</li>
