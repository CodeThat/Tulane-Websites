        <h2>Electronics</h2>

        <p>When you need quality electronic kits, think first of Maxwell Scientific. Our
        kits will provide your students with a wide variety of interesting and fun
        projects. Remember, every kit comes with a teacher's manual and a packet of
        professionally-designed lesson plans.</p>

        <h2>Oersted's Lucky Lecture</h2>

        <p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, electricity and magnetism had been
        seen as two entirely different forces. This all changed thanks to Hans Christian
        Oersted's lucky lecture..</p>

        <p>Oersted had been using a strong battery in one of his lectures, and as he
        concluded his talk he placed a current-carrying wire over a compass. To his
        surprise, the compass begain to move quickly from the north direction to the east
        directon, as if it were in the presence of an intense magnetic field. Oersted
        reversed the flow of the electric current and the compass promptly began pointing
        west.</p>

        <p>As soon as Oersted announced his discovery, physicists all over Europe
        duplicated the experiment and quickly realized that electricity and magnetism
        were two aspects of the same force. Today we refer to this force as
        electromagnetism, thanks, in part, to Oersted's lucky lecture.</p>
