        <h2>Run the Messier Marathon</h2>

        <p>It's time for the annual Messier Marathon. Instead of lacing up their Nikes,
        amateur astronomers will be hauling telescopes, star charts, and a hefty pot of
        coffee in an all-night vigil hunting the Messier objects.</p>

        <p>Messier objects are stellar objects, classified by astronomer Charles Messier
        in the 18th century, ranging from distant galaxies to star clusters to stellar
        nebula. March is the only month in the year in which all 110 Messier objects are
        in the sky. Unfortunately, if you want to see all of them, you have to start
        looking right after sunset and continue until just before sunrise - hence the
        term,"marathon."</p>

        <p>Ironically, Charles Messier wasn't all that interested in his objects. He made
        the list in order to avoid seeing them. Messier was more interested in
        discovering new comets and these beautiful stellar objects were often mistaken
        for comets before Messier made his list.</p>
